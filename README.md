# The Crop Production Game

## Overview of the games targets
This game is aimed at KS2 / KS3 Geography Students
### KS2:
- Fieldwork
- Crop Rotations and the farming year
- Soils
### KS3:
- Crop Rotations and the farming year
- Fieldwork
- Human Geography
  - Economic Activity
- Physical Geography
  - Soils
  - Weather and Climate
### Other
The Game also covers very small amounts of KS2 Science (Pollination and plant growth) and KS3 Biology (Ecosystem). The Game could easily be adapted to different scenarios by adding some targeted playing cards.

## Resources
You will need to print:-
- 1 pack of "play cards"
- Enough crop cards for the number of teams/players
  - 3 cards of each crop per player / team
- 50 player tokens for each team/player
  - The files are included for 3d printing these but realisticaly any tokens could be used for this aspect.

Card backings have been provided, one style should be used on the back of the "Play Cards" and the other on the back of the "Crop Cards" for easy differentiation. Simply print the cards on one side of the card, place back in the printer carful of orientation and print the backing on the other side before laminating.

All the cards are designed to be printed on card, laminated and then cut out. each card has a cutting template around them including rounding of the corners.


## How To Play
#### Number of Players/Teams: 3-6
Each player or team receives one playing pack;
Each pack contains;
•	50 playing tokens
•	18 Crop Cards
o	3 Winter Wheat
o	3 Winter Barley
o	3 Winter Oilseed Rape
o	3 Spring Barley
o	3 Spring Oats
o	3 Environmental Area
The Organiser retains the admin Pack which contains:
•	26 Play Cards
o	10 Weather
o	7 Policy/Market
o	4 Innovation
o	5 Local

Each team selects any combination of 5 crop cards, These should be placed on the table with the starting tokens on top or to one side of the card, the tokens need to be clearly identifiable with the relevant crop card.

The remaining tokens should be placed in a reserve pile on the table ready for use if required. The remaining crop cards can return to the pack.

Once all the teams have set themselves up, the organiser takes the play cards and shuffles them (these can be chosen if a particular card is very relevant to teaching). These are fanned out and going clockwise the first player picks a card and reads its effect. Cards effect all players unless it specifically says “this player” or similar. All players then respond by making token adjustments as necessary, and the organiser can elaborate on the card. Play passes to the next player who is offered to select from the cards and play repeats. Dependant on time play can continue until the end of the cards or be stopped at the end of a round, all players should be offered an equal number of cards.

A crop can only ever reach zero, a negative score is not possible, and the next play can add tokens back to that crop.

Once all the play cards are flipped a final tally of total tokens scored by each player is taken and the one with the most wins. 

The cards can be photographed if organisers want to discuss them further in class.

## Feedback and Adjustments
I would love to hear your feedback on the project. If you come accross anything you feel should be adjusted or just enjoy using the game please do let me know. I will also be happy to make adjustments if required subject to my time availability.
